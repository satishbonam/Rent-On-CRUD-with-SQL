# Contributing to Masai School

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

Contributing for the first time? We got you covered, visit this [link](https://github.com/masai-oss/open-template/blob/master/FIRST_CONTRIBUTOR.md) for the First Time Guidelines.

## We Develop with Github
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use Github Flow). We actively welcome your pull requests:

- Fork the repo and create your branch from master.
- If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
- If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
- Ensure the test suite passes.
- Make sure your code lints.
- Issue that pull request!

## Report bugs using Github's issues
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by opening a new issue; it's that easy!

Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code
Here's a good example from Craig Hockenberry with detailed bug report (http://www.openradar.me/11905408)

### Great Bug Reports tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
- Be specific!
- Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)
- People love thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.

## Use a Consistent Coding Style
We use Pep8 for Python and Google JavaScript Style Guide for JS. Visit this [link](https://github.com/masai-oss/open-template/blob/master/CODE_GUIDE.md) for coding guidlines on our projects.
